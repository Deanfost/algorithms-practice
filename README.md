# algorithms-practice
Algorithms practice in Javascript, since the syntax is simlar to Java, but far less verbose. Includes several sorting algorithms from Bubble Sort to Quick Sort, and some tree traversal algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Testing
The project has a basic test suite which can be executed by running **node test_driver.js** under the tests folder.
